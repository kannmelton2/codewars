/*
Prompt:
Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

For the beginner, try to use the map method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.
*/

const double = (arr) => arr.map((x) => x*2);

/*
Notes:
They gave away the solution with the hint for using the map method, I will not refactor.
